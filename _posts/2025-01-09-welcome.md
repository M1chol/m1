# Hi!
Im Michał, and as you can see, this is my personal blog. Here, you can find updates on my projects, tutorials, and probably some other things in the future :)
<!--more-->
For starters, here are my two projects that are currently active:
1. SpaceGame - a roguelike game written in C++
2. Home Assistant `Atom` - written in Python, designed for smart mirrors

So, my goal with this blog is, first of all, to share some of my problems and troubleshooting experiences. And second of all, to keep me working on the projects. Let's hope that when I share the progress of the projects with others, I'll be more motivated to work on them. I'll also plan to share the research and tutorials based aroud my projects.

To see more info about me check out my [About]({{ site.base_url }}/about) page.

So this is it, the first blog post. Let's hope I can keep this project afloat for as long as I can.
