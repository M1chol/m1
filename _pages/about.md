# Hi!
I'm Michał, and I'm a 21 yo student from Poland. I love creating things, programming, and I'm a huge advocate of open source. You can check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/M1chol)  and feel free to explore my [blog posts](https://m1chol.github.io/m1/) for insights on my projects. I'm proficient in C++ and Python, but I've worked with many other languages as well. Currently, I'm studying Cryptology and Cybersecurity at the Warsaw Military University of Technology (civil).

If you wish to contact me, feel free to reach out at `m1chol@proton.me`

Thanks for reading!
